    "**MOTIVATION**\n",
    "\n",
    "Water is a ubiquitous resource to man, sadly a reasonable amount of water is lost due to various factors including leakages in the water distribution system. This phenomenon presents a very precarious situation for water distribution companies as leaked water otherwise known as non-resource water results in financial losses for any water distribution company. I have decided to present an algorithmic approach to mitigating water leakages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**THE DATASET**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project was downloaded open-source from https://marketplace.wessexwater.co.uk/dataset/2nkmn/leakage-acoustic-logger-data. It contains no sensitive information. The data provides useful time-series information returned by leakage detection devices situated in water distribution systems which record valuable real-time.\n",
    "The dataset contains several excel sheets, but for the purpose of this project we have extracted (columns A to J) from Acoustic logger data, and concatenated it with Columns O to AH – Asset information and GIS-related calculations file.\n",
    "PROBLEM STATEMENT\n",
    "Develop an algorithmic approach to detect leakages in water distribution systems using supervised machine learning and predictive analytics.\n",
    "CONTENT\n",
    "Data exploration and pre-processing the data including data cleaning, feature engineering, feature extraction by principal component analysis\n",
    "Employing logistic regression, random forest and artificial neural network classification algorithms to predict water leakages.\n",
    "Evaluating model performance via significant metrics\n",
    "Discussion\n",
    "Limitation and Improvement\n",
    "The dataset has only input values and no target, however, we can create a binary class label for the purpose of this analysis. The original documentation specifies that the feature Spread which is the difference between the minimum recorded noise and the most frequently occurring noise. It is believed to serve as a measure of consistency. It is believed that the smaller the spread, the less likely for a leak to occur.\n",
    "On the premise above we discretize the feature Spread by performing a median split, all values smaller than the median value (2.5) are considered a non-leak and assigned a value of 0, while values of spread greater than the median are considered as possible leaks and assigned a value of 1. We then create a new variable called Target to store these binary labels and serve as the target feature during modelling. With this split, we create a dichotomous scenario that typifies a binary classification. We can therefore use supervised machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, Random forest and a neural network to predict Leakages."

    "In this project, I have presented an algorithmic approach to leakage detection in a water distribution system using machine learning and deep learning. I have implemented three models logistic regression, random forest and a neural network with 56%, 65%, 65% accuracy scores respectively. This can be deployed to detect leakages using streaming(real-time)data generated by sensors and transmitted via the cloud services to the company's database. which could significantly reduce the number of leakages encountered in water distribution systems, and therefore save cost.\n",

    "The Ideal leakage detection algorithm should be able to detect all leakages based on streaming data with few false positives, and the detection should be preventive i.e before it becomes visible to humans. The major limitation encountered in this project is data availability- the presence of open-source data relating to historic leakages is almost non-existent due to confidentiality reasons as a dataset of such nature usually contain sensitive customer information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used for this experiment contains no direct records for leakages, I have created a target column based on the assumption that the Spread is directly proportional to leakage occurrence as stated above. The median split is not the most intuitive as it assumes that values just above and below the median are only slightly dissimilar which may have prevented the achievement of higher accuracy values. To achieve a more reliable result, we would have to retrain the models with actual historical data.  \n",
